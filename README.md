JavaSIM has been available since 1997 and is an object-oriented simulation package based upon C++SIM. It provides discrete event process-based simulation similar to SIMULA's simulation class and libraries. A complete list of the facilities provided follows:

- the core of the system gives SIMULA-like simulation routines, random number generators, queueing algorithms, and thread package interfaces.
- entity and set manipulation facilities similar to SIMSET.
- classes allow "non-causal" events, such as interrupts, to be handled.
- various statistical gathering routines, such as histogram and variance classes.
- debugging classes.

The system also comes with complete examples and test routines which illustrate many of the issues raised in using the simulation package. It is used by many commercial and academic organisations.

Prior to 2007 both C++SIM and JavaSim were freely available in source and binary from Newcastle University, under their own licence. However, in late 2007 the University decided that the code can be released into open source under LGPL.

We are in the process of providing new releases of JavaSim and C++SIM. In the meantime, if you want the old versions then you can find C++SIM 1.7.4 GA and JavaSim 0.3 GA available from our downloads repository.

In 2015 we moved from Codehaus.
